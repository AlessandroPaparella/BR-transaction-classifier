A classifier for back-runable ethereum transactions made with neural network.

## 1. About
I created this classifier during a competition on the recognition of ethereum transactions subject to back-running (more information on this can be found in the useful links). 

This repository shows only the best performing model that the author has been able to obtain, and is the result of several tests and tuning steps of the model.
